I'm a microbiologist, microbial ecologist, and bioinformatician interested in understanding microbial community structure and dynamics in the environment. More specifically, I'm interested in studying how perturbations and biogeochemical gradients effect microbial assemblage structure and function. 

For my PhD at the [University of Georgia](http://mib.uga.edu/) with [Tim Hollibaugh](http://www.marsci.uga.edu/directory/people/james-t-hollibaugh), I studied the role of bacteria in transformation of arsenic-sulfur compounds [(thioarsenates)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac1024717) in Mono Lake, CA, a hypersaline soda lake. We also took a more general approach to understanding the structure and potential function of microbial communities at different depths under varying biogeochemical gradients with depth. Tools that I've include [culture-based microbiology](https://academic.oup.com/femsec/article/90/3/858/541840), [metatranscriptomics](https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej201780), and [16S rRNA amplicon analyses](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00014/full).

In addition, I've been using metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to learn more about the "microbial dark matter" [(for lack of a better term right now...)](http://merenlab.org/2017/06/22/microbial-dark-matter/) in Mono Lake, as well as analyzing the transcriptional abundance of a phytoplankton (Picocystis) that is highly abundant in the lake. 

As a postdoc with the [Shedd Aquarium Microbiome Project](https://www.sheddaquarium.org/aquariummicrobiomeproject/), my role has been to develop and implement a 16S rRNA pipeline and analyze a variety of baseline and observational studies on animals, animal habitats, and aquarium life support systems. I'm also looking at the effect of ozone on microbial community structure in artifical seawater systems. Finally, I am working on analyzing a 10 year time-series analysis of the marine mammal habitat at Shedd, with [Angela Kent](https://nres.illinois.edu/directory/akent) at the University of Illinois, to understand how microbial communities in artifical marine mammal habitats change over time with different management strategies.
